# My emacs settings

A hodge-podge of stuff, much of it copied as needed from [magnar's setup](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

As a former VIM user, I'm impressed by Emacs's flexibility. Evil-mode makes me feel mostly at home, so the adaptation required was smaller than I expected.

Enjoy and copy freely to your configuration files!
