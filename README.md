# My emacs settings

A hodge-podge of stuff, much of it copied as needed from [magnar's setup](https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d).

As a former VIM user, I'm impressed by Emacs's flexibility. Evil-mode makes me feel mostly at home, so the adaptation required was smaller than I expected.

Enjoy and copy freely to your configuration files!

## Getting started on a fresh machine

```bash
git clone $REPO_URL
emacs
```

Nothing else is necessary, straight.el will take care of downloading the dependencies according to the [lockfile](./straight/versions/default.el).
